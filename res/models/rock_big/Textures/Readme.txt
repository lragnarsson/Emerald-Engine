I added the psd for further customization by the user.
Every layer has its name and is self explanatory.

Ambient occlusion layer : shadows and cracks details

Moss layer : Moss, can be replaced by other textures such as sand or other detail.

HighLights layer : the hight lights on the edges of the rock.

Color map : the base texture of the rock, can be replaced by another texture (desert rock texture, canyon like...)  
 Also can be replaced by another tiled texture depending on how you are going to use the rock.
