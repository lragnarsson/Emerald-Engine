Low poly Dry tree for Games.
Compress the textures as you like.


Was originally made for old game engine Reality Factory,(make games with no programming).
RF had a big success iin its days.

If anyone is interested,a new open source Reality Factory,the RF2 is on now in develpment,but there is only one developer whith little time to spare 
on the project and progress,
So,if any programmer is interested to help developing this wonderful Game engine that will make game developing easy to anyone,
can get the code from there and start working
